Donald Knuth released \TeX\ in 1978, motivated at least in part by his
unhappiness with the way that the second volume of \textit{The Art
of Computer Programming} was typeset by his publishers. It is quite
amazing that forty years later \TeX, and its derivatives such as \LaTeX, is
still the de facto standard for writing books and papers in technical
fields such as computer science, mathematics, engineering and physics.

\TeX\ was designed for publishing high quality printed research articles
and books.  Over the last twenty years the field of publishing has
changed dramatically with many sources now being published and read
online.  Using packages like \ctan{TeX4ht} and \ctan{lwarp}, the capabilities of
\TeX\ have expanded so that it is now possible to use \TeX\ and \LaTeX\
to write web pages and online material.

One of the reasons why \TeX\ has been so successful is that it gives a
relatively easy to write high quality papers and books. One of the big
changes in publishing online is that it is now possible to write dynamic
web pages that ``respond'' and ``interact'' with the user. Such pages
usually require sophisticated javascript, which puts them beyond the
capabilities of many authors.
