\begin{discussion}[Credits]
  \MathQuiz{} is a HTML quiz preparation system which was written and
   developed in the
  \href{http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/}{School of Mathematics and Statistics}
   at the
   \href{http://www.usyd.edu.au/}{University of Sydney}. The system is built on
   \LaTeX{} with the conversion from \LaTeX{} to HTML being done by
   Eitan Gurari's
  \href{http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/~gurari/TeX4ht/mn.html}{TeX4ht}
    and some python programs.

    \quad\newline
   The \LaTeX{} component of \MathQuiz{} was written by Andrew Mathas and the python
   and javascript code were written by Andrew Mathas and Don Taylor, based on an
   initial protype of Don Taylor's. A related system which produces quizzes for self
   assessment tests was written by a team supervised by Daniel Daners (see
   \href{http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au:8000/us/selftest.cgi}{example test}).
