WebQuiz: a LaTeX_ package for writing online quizzes
====================================================

WebQuiz_ makes it possible to use LaTeX_ to write interactive online quizzes.
The quizzes are first written in LaTeX_ and then converted into HTML using
WebQuiz_, which is written in python. The conversion from LaTeX_ to HTML is
done behind the scenes using TeX4ht_. The idea is that you should be able to
produce nice online quizzes using WebQuiz_ and basic knowledge of LaTeX_.

WebQuiz_ is designed to be used from the command-line.  For example, if
`quiz1.tex` is a LaTeX file for a quiz then:

:`latex quiz1`:
    produces a "readable" DVI file for the quiz
:`pdflatex quiz1`:
    produces a "readable" PDF file for the quiz
:`webquiz quiz1`:
    creates the web page `quiz1.html`

If you prefer to use LaTeX_ from a GUI for LaTeX_ then it should be possible to
configure it to use WebQuiz_ directly. As an example, the manual provides some
details about how to do this for TeXShop.
