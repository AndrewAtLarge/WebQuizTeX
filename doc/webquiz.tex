  \section{Introduction}
      On-line quizzes provide a good way to reinforce learning, especially
      because they can give ``interactive'' feedback to the
      students\footnote{Throughout this manual, ``student'' means any
      person taking the on-line quiz.\index{student}} based on the answers that they
      give. Unfortunately, in addition to writing the actual quiz content there
      are significant technical hurdles that need to be overcome when
      writing an on-line quiz -- and there are additional complications if
      the quiz involves mathematics or diagrams.

      \WebQuiz makes it possible to write on-line quizzes using \LaTeX,
      which is the typesetting language used by mathematicians who use
      \LaTeX\ to write their research papers, books and teaching
      materials. In principle, a \WebQuiz quiz can contain anything that
      can be typeset using \LaTeX.  In practise, the \LaTeX\ is converted
      to \HTML using \TeXfht (and
      \ctan{make4ht}), so the
      quizzes can contain any \LaTeX commands that are understood by \TeX
      4ht, which is almost everything. In particular, it is possible to
      use graphics constructed using packages like \ctan{pstricks} and
      \ctan{tikz}; see \autoref{SS:graphics}.

      \WebQuiz supports the following three types of questions:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple choice questions with a unique correct answer
        \item Multiple choice questions zero or more correct answers
        \item Questions with an answer that is supplied by the student.
      \end{itemize}
      Each time a student answers a question it is possible to give them
      feedback, reinforcing their learning when they answer correctly and
      giving them further hints when they are wrong. This allows the
      quiz author to give targeted feedback to the student based on their
      answer.

      The on-line quizzes constructed using \WebQuiz can, in principle,
      contain anything that can be typeset by \LaTeX. In particular, they
      do not need to contain mathematics. In fact, the quizzes do not even
      have to contain ``questions'' as it is possible for a \WebQuiz
      ``quiz'' to contain only \LatexCode|discussion| environments that can
      be used to revise material, or to introduce new material, for the
      students; see \autoref{SS:discussion}.

      This introduction outlines how to use \WebQuiz, however, the
      impatient reader may want to skip ahead directly to the
      \autoref{S:documentclass}, where the \LaTeX\ commands used by
      \WebQuiz are described.

      The easiest way to explain how \WebQuiz works is by example. The
      following \LaTeX\ file defines a quiz with a single multiple choice
      question that has four possible answers, each of which has a
      customised response. Giving feedback to the students in each
      question is optional but the capability of being able to give
      students feedback on their answer is one of the main pedagogical
      advantages of on-line quizzes.

      \InputLatexCode{simple}

      Since this is a \LaTeX\ file it can be processed using
      \BashCode|pdflatex|, or \BashCode|latex|, to produce a readable and
      printable version of the quiz, which can be useful when
      proofreading. In this case, the \LaTeX\ version of the quiz looks
      like this:
      \ScreenShot[0.5]{Sample \BashCode|PDF| output}{simple-pdf}
      Of course, the real reason for using \WebQuiz is that it is also
      possible to make an on-line version of the quiz by processing the
      quiz using the \BashCode|webquiz| command. If you do this, open
      the resulting web page in your favourite browser and select answer~(a),
      then you will see a web page like this:
      \ScreenShot{Sample web page}{simple-html}
      In fact, the appearance of the web page depends partly on your
      choice of browser.

      By default, the on-line version of the quiz displays one question at
      a time, with the question buttons serving the dual purpose of
      navigation between questions and displaying how successful the
      student was in answering the question. The decorations on the
      question buttons indicate whether the question has been attempted
      and, if so, whether it was answered correctly or incorrectly on the
      first or subsequent attempts. One of the main points of \WebQuiz is
      that (optional) targeted feedback can be given to the student taking
      the quiz based on their responses.

  \subsection{What WebQuiz does and does not do}

      \WebQuiz is a tool that makes it possible to write ``interactive''
      on-line quizzes using \LaTeX{}. To use \WebQuiz you only need to
      know how to use \LaTeX{} and, in particular, no knowledge of the
      underlying \CSS, \HTML or \Javascript is required.

      \WebQuiz can be used to ask students a series of ``quiz'' questions
      and for writing on-line course content directly from a \LaTeX{}
      document using the \WebQuiz \LatexCode{discussion} environment (see
      \autoref{SS:discussion}). You can write \WebQuiz quizzes that only
      contain questions an no \LatexCode|discussion|, quizzes that contain
      questions and \LatexCode|discussion| and (psuedo) quizzes that
      contain not questions and only \LatexCode{discussion}.

      By default, the on-line quizzes display one question (or
      \LatexCode|discussion| environment) at a time.  It is also possible
      to display all of the quiz questions on a single web page
      (\autoref{SS:classOptions}). One of the key features of \WebQuiz is
      that you can give feedback to the students based on their answers.
      In this way you can give hints to the students to correct their
      mistakes and you can reinforce the students' understanding when they
      are correct. Each question in a quiz, and each quiz itself, can be
      attempted as many times as the student wants: \WebQuiz does not
      limit the number of times that questions can be attempted.

      The following question types are currently supported:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Multiple choice questions with a unique correct answer
        \item Multiple choice questions zero or more correct answers
        \item Questions that require students to type in an answer. There
        are several different ``comparison'' methods available for
        comparing the students answer where
        for example, the entered answers can be a ``string'' or a ``number''.
      \end{itemize}

      Questions can appear in either the same order that they appear in
      the \LaTeX{} file for the quiz or in a random order that changes
      each time the quiz page is loaded. For multiple choice questions the
      order in which the choices appear is always the order that they
      appear in the \LaTeX{} file for the quiz, even if the questions
      appear in random order.

      \WebQuiz supports several different languages and it
      provides a number of different colour schemes (see
      \autoref{SS:commandline} and \hyperref[SS:themes]{Appendix A}).

      \WebQuiz quizzes are not timed and they do not have time-limits.

      Quizzes made using \WebQuiz are intended to be used as a
      revision resource rather than as an assessment tool. In particular,
      \WebQuiz does not provide a mechanism for recording the marks
      obtained by the students taking the quiz
      (\autoref{SS:classOptions}). Technically, it probably would not be
      very hard to record marks but this introduces a significant amount
      of extra overhead in terms of student authentication and interfacing
      with a database. In addition, if \WebQuiz were used as an assessment
      tool then there would be additional ``security issues'' to ensure
      that the quiz content is secure. Currently, even though the
      solutions to the quiz questions do not appear in the \HTML source
      code for the quiz pages it is possible to access the answers if you
      know what you are doing.

      The questions in a \WebQuiz quiz are static. In particular, they do
      not accept variables.

      The \WebQuiz program was designed to be run from the command-line.
      To process the file \BashCode|quiz.tex| using \WebQuiz you would
      type
      \begin{bashcode}
      > webquiz quiz|         or         > webquiz quiz.tex|
      \end{bashcode}
      (Throughout this manual, \BashCode|>| is used for the command-line
      prompt.) \index{$>$ command-line prompt}
      It should be possible to run \WebQuiz from inside programs like \TeX
      Shop by setting the compiler equal to \BashCode|webquiz|, although
      this is untested.

  \subsection{Credits}
      \WebQuiz{} was written and developed in the
      \href{http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/}{School of Mathematics and
      Statistics} at the \href{http://www.usyd.edu.au/}{University of
      Sydney}.  The system is built on \LaTeX{} with the conversion from
      \LaTeX{} to \HTML being done by Eitan Gurari's
      \TeXfht and \ctan{make4ht}.

      To write quizzes using \WebQuiz it is only necessary to know
      \LaTeX, however, the underlying \WebQuiz system actually has three
      components:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item A \href{https://www.latex-project.org/}{\LaTeX} document class
        file, \BashCode|webquiz.cls|, and a \TeXfht
        configuration file, \BashCode|webquiz.cfg|, that enables the
        quiz files to be processed by \LaTeX{} and \TeXfht, respectively.
        \item A \python program,
        \BashCode|webquiz|, that translates the
        \LaTeX{} into \XML, using \TeXfht, and then into \HTML.
        \item \CSS, \HTML and \Javascript code controls and style the
        quiz web pages.
      \end{itemize}

     The \LaTeX{} component of \WebQuiz{} was written by Andrew Mathas and
     the \python, \CSS and \Javascript code was written by Andrew Mathas (and
     Don Taylor), based on an initial prototype of Don Taylor's from 2001.
     Since 2004 the program has been maintained and developed by Andrew
     Mathas. Although the program has changed substantially since 2004,
     Don's idea of using \TeXfht, and some of his code, is still
     in use. Prior to releasing \WebQuiz on \Ctan, the program was known
     as \texttt{MathQuiz}.

     Thanks are due to Bob Howlett for general help with \CSS and to
     Michal Hoftich for invaluable technical advice on \TeXfht.

   \section{The WebQuiz document class --- \LaTeX{} commands}
   \label{S:documentclass}

    \WebQuiz makes it possible to write on-line quizzes using only \LaTeX.
    This chapter describes the \LaTeX{} components of \WebQuiz, which are
    the commands and environments that are used to construct the quiz web
    pages. All of the code examples given in this and other sections can
    be found in the \BashCode|examples| directory of the \WebQuiz web
    directory. Once \WebQuiz is initialised you can find the
    \WebQuiz web directory using the command:
    \begin{bashcode}
         webquiz --settings webquiz-www
    \end{bashcode}
    Additional examples can be found in the \OnlineManual, which is
    included, in \BashCode|PDF| form, as \hyperref[S:online]{Appendix B}.

    This chapter describes the commands and environments provided by the
    \WebQuiz document class. This assumes that you have already installed
    and configured \WebQuiz. If you have not yet initialised \WebQuiz
    then please follow the instructions in \autoref{S:configuration}.

    A typical \WebQuiz quiz file is a \LaTeX{} file of the form:

      \InputLatexCode{typicalquizfile}

    \noindent You should write your quizzes using the editor that you
    normally use to write \LaTeX. As you write your quiz, say
    \texttt{quiz.tex}, you should use (\BashCode|latex| or)
    \BashCode|pdflatex| in the usual way:
    \begin{bashcode}
        > pdflatex quiz
    \end{bashcode}
    This is the easiest way to check that your quiz compiles and to
    proofread the output, just as if you were writing a normal \LaTeX{}
    document. When you are satisfied with the content of the quiz, then
    you can convert the quiz to an on-line quiz using the command
    \begin{bashcode}
       > webquiz quiz
    \end{bashcode}
    The quiz file, \BashCode|quizfile.tex|, should be on your web server
    because \WebQuiz creates a number of different files and directories
    when it converts the file into an on-line quiz and all of these files
    are needed to display the quiz on the web.

    The reasons for using this workflow are:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item \textit{Every file that you give to \WebQuiz must be a valid
      \LaTeX{} file!}

      \item The \BashCode|dvi| or \BashCode|PDF| file produced by \LaTeX{}
      shows all of the information in the quiz
      \textit{in an easy-to-read format}. That is, the \BashCode|PDF| file
      displays the questions, the answers and the feedback that you are
      giving to the students. In contrast, by design, the on-line version
      of the quiz hides most of this information and displays it to the
      student only when they need to see it.

      \item Typesetting the quiz file with \LaTeX{} is \textit{much
      faster} than processing it with \WebQuiz. In fact, \WebQuiz uses
      \BashCode|htlatex| to process the quiz file at least
      \textit{three times} in order to produce an \XML file and it is only
      then that the \WebQuiz program kicks in to rewrite this data as an
      \HTML file.

      \item If \LaTeX{} produces errors then \WebQuiz will produce more
      errors. Further, \textit{\LaTeX{} error messages are much easier to
      read and understand than those produced by \TeXfht and \WebQuiz}.
    \end{itemize}
    This said, \WebQuiz does check for more errors in the quiz than
    \LaTeX{} is (easily) able to do.

    The \BashCode|PDF| version of a quiz does not contain information about
    the unit, department or institution, which can be used in the
    breadcrumbs.

    The next sections describe the commands and environments provided by
    \WebQuiz for typesetting quizzes as well as the document-class options
    for the package. If you plan to use \ctan{pstricks} or
    \ctan[pgf]{tikz} then you should read \autoref{SS:graphics}, which
    describes how to use graphics in a \WebQuiz quiz.
    \autoref{SS:config} describes a work-around for using (some?) \LaTeX{}
    features that have not been configured for use with \TeXfht.

  \subsection{Question environments}

  The \WebQuiz document class defines the following four environments:
  \begin{quote}
    \begin{description}
      \item[question] Each quiz question needs to be inside
      \LatexCode|question| environment
      \item[choice] Typesets multiple choice questions, with
      one or more correct answers
      \item[discussion] Includes (optional) discussion, or revision,
      material at the start of the quiz web page
      \item[quizindex] Writes an index file for the quizzes in
      a ``unit of study'' and generates drop-drop menus in each quiz for
      the unit
    \end{description}
  \end{quote}
  This section describes these environments and gives examples
  of their use.

  \subsubsection{Question environments and the
         \textcolor{blue}{\textbackslash answer} macro}
  \CrossIndex{environment}{question}

  Each quiz question must be placed inside a \LatexCode|question|
  environment. Typically, a quiz has several questions, each wrapped in
  its own \LatexCode|question| environment.  For brevity, most of the
  examples in this chapter have only one question. See the
  \OnlineManual, in the \WebQuiz web directory for a more complete quiz
  file.

  This manual describes the \WebQuiz commands, often by example. The
  following code-block generates a quiz with one question for which the
  student has to enter the answer. This answer is then compared with the
  correct answer as a string, which it must match exactly.
    \InputLatexCode{answer-string}
    \macroIndex{answer}\CrossIndex{question environment}*{answer}
    \CrossIndex*{answer}*{whenRight}
    \CrossIndex*{answer}*{whenWrong}
    \index{feedback!whenRight}
    \index{feedback!whenWrong}
    The \textit{optional} macros \LatexCode|\whenRight| and
    \LatexCode|\whenWrong| are used to give the student additional
    feedback, when they are right, or further hints etc for approaching
    the question, when they are wrong. This feedback is displayed on the
    quiz page only when the student checks their answer.

    The web page created by the code above, when an incorrect answer of
    ``canberra'', instead of ``Canberra'' is given, looks something like
    the following:
    \ScreenShot{A question with an answer}{answer-string}
    This example shows one way of using the \LatexCode|\answer| macro, which
    asks for the student to type in an answer to the question. The general syntax of
    this macro is:
    \begin{latexcode}
        \answer[comparison type]{correct answer}
    \end{latexcode}
    where the optional \textit{comparison type} is one of:
    \begin{latexcode}
        complex    integer    lowercase    number    string
    \end{latexcode}
    with \LatexCode|string| being the default.  In addition, there is a
    $*$-variant of the answer macro that does not print the word
    ``Answer'' (or equivalent in other languages) before the input box.
    The syntax for the \LatexCode|\answer*| command is identical to that
    for the \LatexCode|\answer| except, of course, that there is a~$*$:
    \begin{latexcode}
        \answer*[comparison type]{correct answer}
    \end{latexcode}
    As \LatexCode|string| is the default answer comparison method, if we
    instead use \LatexCode|\answer*{Canberra}| in the last example then
    the quiz page generated by \WebQuiz looks like:
    \ScreenShot{A question with answer$*$}{answer-star}
    We now give a description of the other comparison types for the
    \LatexCode|\answer| and \LatexCode|\answer*| macros together with
    code examples and screenshots.

    \CrossIndex*{answer}{complex}
    \begin{heading}[complex comparison] The answers are compared as complex
    numbers: the answer is marked as correct if it has the same real and
    imaginary parts.
    \InputLatexCode{answer-complex}
    \ScreenShot{A question with a complex answer}{answer-complex}
    \end{heading}

    \begin{heading}[integer comparison] The answers are compared as
    integers. If the correct answer was $18$ and the students entered
    $36/2$ then they would be marked wrong.
    \CrossIndex*{answer}{integer}
    \InputLatexCode{answer-integer}
    \ScreenShot{A question with a integer answer}{answer-integer}
    \end{heading}

    \begin{heading}[lowercase comparison] The quiz answer and the
    students' answer are both converted to lower case and then compared as
    strings.
    \CrossIndex*{answer}{lowercase}
    \InputLatexCode{answer-lowercase}
    \ScreenShot{A question with a lowercase string answer}{answer-lowercase}
    \end{heading}

    \begin{heading}[number comparison] The quiz answer and the students'
    answer are compared as numbers. For example, if the answer was $0.75$ and the student
    answered $\frac 34$ then they would be marked correct.
    \CrossIndex*{answer}{number}
    \InputLatexCode{answer-number}
    \ScreenShot{A question with a numeric answer}{answer-number}
    \end{heading}

    \begin{heading}[string comparison]
    This is the default, so \LatexCode|\answer{word}| and
    \LatexCode|\answer[string]{word}| are equivalent. The student's
    answer is marked correct if and only if it agrees exactly with
    the quiz answer.
    \CrossIndex*{answer}{string}
    \end{heading}

    \subsubsection{Multiple choice questions}\label{SS:choice}
    \CrossIndex{environment}{choice}
    \CrossIndex{question environment}{choice environment}
    \SeeIndex{multiple choice}{choice environment}

  The multiple choice options for a quiz question need to be placed inside
  a \LatexCode|choice| environment -- and every \LatexCode|choice|
  environment needs to be inside a \LatexCode|question| environment.

  The \LatexCode|choice| environment accepts two optional arguments,
  can appear in any order:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item\CrossIndex{choice environment}{single}
         \CrossIndex{choice environment}{multiple}
    The word \LatexCode|single| (default, and can be omitted) or
    \LatexCode|multiple|, which indicates whether the quiz has a
    \textit{single} correct answer or whether 0 or more of the answers are
    correct, respectively.
    \item \index{choice environment!columns}
    The number of \textit{columns} in which to typeset the choices. This
    is specified as \LatexCode|columns=n|, where $n$ is a non-negative integer.
    By default, the choices appear in $n=1$ columns
    (\DefaultValue{columns=1}).
  \end{itemize}
  The key difference between these two types of \LatexCode|choice|
  questions is that a \LatexCode|single|-choice environment uses radio
  boxes, so it is only possible to select \textit{one correct answer}, whereas in a
  \LatexCode|multiple|-choice environment checkboxes are used, so that is
  possible to select \textit{zero or more correct answers}.

  A \LatexCode|choice| environment modelled on the standard
  \LaTeX{} list environments (\textit{enumerate}, \textit{itemize},
  \textit{description}, ...), except that instead of using the
  \LatexCode|\item| command to separate the items the
  \LatexCode|choice| environment uses \LatexCode|\correct|
  \CrossIndex{choice environment}*{correct} \LatexCode|\incorrect|
  \CrossIndex{choice environment}*{incorrect}, which indicate correct
  and incorrect answers respectively.  In addition, after each
  \LatexCode|\correct| or \LatexCode|\incorrect| you can, optionally, use
  \LatexCode|\response| \CrossIndex{choice environment}*{response} to give
  a feedback response to the student taking the quiz. Like
  \LatexCode|\whenRight| and \LatexCode|\whenWrong| this feedback is
  displayed only when the student checks their answer.
  \index{feedback!response}

  Here is an example of a \LatexCode|single|-choice question with a unique
  answer:
    \InputLatexCode{choice-single}
  Note that \LatexCode|single| is the default, so this could also be written as
  \begin{latexcode}
    \begin{choice}[columns=3, single]
      ...
    \end{choice}
  \end{latexcode}
  It is not necessary to put the \LatexCode|\response| lines on the same
  line as the \LatexCode|\incorrect| and \LatexCode|\incorrect|; this is
  done only to make the example more compact. This results in the
  following web page:
  \ScreenShot{Single answer multiple choice question}{choice-single}

  Here is an example of a multiple choice question that has
  two correct answers:
    \InputLatexCode{choice-multiple}
  Notice that this example uses the documentclass-option
  \LatexCode{theme=vibrant}, which changes the \WebQuiz colour theme;
  see \autoref{SS:classOptions}.
  \ScreenShot{Multi-answer multiple choice question}{choice-multiple}

  When the optional argument \LatexCode|multiple| is used, as above,
  then the question is marked correct if and only if \textit{all} of the
  correct responses are selected. Feedback to the students is randomly
  selected from the feedback for their wrong responses (that is, the
  \LatexCode|\correct| responses that they have not selected and the
  \LatexCode|\incorrect| responses that they have selected).

  Finally, observe that the multiple choice items in the screenshot
  above are labelled by roman numerals. The items in a
  \LatexCode{choice} are labelled by a standard \LaTeX{} counter, called
  \LatexCode|choice|. Redefining \LatexCode|\thechoice| changes how the
  items in the on-line quiz are labelled. For example, to label the
  items in a \LatexCode|choice| environment by A), B), C) $\dots$ add
  \begin{latexcode}
    \renewcommand\thechoice{\Alph{choice})}
  \end{latexcode}
  to the preamble of the \LaTeX{} file for your quiz.
  \CrossIndex{choice environment}*{thechoice}\macroIndex{thechoice}

  \subsubsection{Discussion environments}\label{SS:discussion}
    \CrossIndex{environment}{discussion}

  In addition to asking questions, it is possible to display revision,
  or discussion, material on the quiz web page using the
  \LatexCode|discussion| environment.  All discussion material is
  displayed on the quiz page \textit{before} the questions in the quiz
  and the (short) titles for the discussion items appear before the quiz
  questions in the menu on the left-hand side of the page --- it is
  not possible to interleave discussion items and questions in the side
  menu.

  Each quiz can have zero or more discussion
  environments (and zero or more question environments) and these
  environments can, in principle, contain arbitrary \LaTeX{} code. The
  syntax for the \LatexCode|discussion| environment is:
  \begin{latexcode}
    \begin{dicussion}[short heading][heading]
      ...
    \end{dicussion}
  \end{latexcode}
  Both the \textit{heading} and \textit{short-heading} are optional,
  defaulting to \LatexCode|Discussion|.
  For example, running the following \LaTeX\ file, which uses
  \LatexCode|theme=muted|, through \WebQuiz
  \InputLatexCode{discussion}
  produces the quiz page:
  \ScreenShot[0.7]{Web page: discussion environment}{discussion}
  As with the questions, only one \LatexCode|discussion| environment is
  displayed on the quiz web page at a time (unless the document-class
  option \LatexCode|onepage| is used). It is possible to have quizzes
  that contain only \LatexCode|discussion| environments, with no
  questions, and quizzes that contain only \LatexCode|question|
  environments, with no discussion.

  \subsubsection{Index pages for qizzes}\label{SS:index}

    \index{quizindex environment}
    \CrossIndex{environment}{quizindex}

    Most quizzes occur in sets that cover related material, such as for
    a particular unit of study. The \LatexCode|quizindex| environment
    creates an index web page for related sets of quizzes. The \LaTeX{}
    files for all of these quizzes be in the same directory, or folder.
    The index web page is a \WebQuiz file of the form:
    \InputLatexCode{index-en}
    which generates a web page that looks like:
    \ScreenShot{Example index page}{index-en}
    As the next section describes, index files are also used to
    automatically add a drop-down menu to the breadcrumbs on the quiz web
    pages. This drop-down menu accesses all of the quizzes for the unit.

    As the example above shows, the entries in the \LatexCode|quizindex| are all
    given using the \LatexCode|\quiz| or the \LatexCode|\quiz*| command.
    \CrossIndex{quizindex environment}*{quiz}
    \CrossIndex{quizindex environment}*{quiz*}
    The syntax for these commands is
    \begin{latexcode}
        \quiz[URL for quiz]{Title for quiz}
        \quiz*[URL for quiz]{Title for quiz}
    \end{latexcode}
    The \LatexCode|\quiz| macro automatically inserts the quiz numbers
    into the index listing. The \LatexCode|\quiz*| command is identical
    \textit{except} that it does not add \BashCode|Quiz 1.|,
    \BashCode|Quiz 2| etc to the index listing. By default, the URLs for
    the quizzes in the index are of the form \BashCode|quiz1.html|,
    \BashCode|quiz2.html|, \BashCode|quiz3.html|, .... These URLs can be
    changed using the optional argument of the  \LatexCode|\quiz| and
    \LatexCode|\quiz*| commands.

    Index pages in other languages are similar. For example,
    \InputLatexCode{index-cz}
    produces:
    \ScreenShot{A Czech index}{index-cz}
    The next section describes the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumb| and
    \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs| commands.

    At most one file in each directory should contain a
    \LatexCode|quizindex| environment whenever a
    \LatexCode|quizindex| environment is compiled with \WebQuiz a file
    \BashCode|quizindex.js| is created in the current directory. As
    described in the next section, this file is used to create drop-down
    menus that list the quiz index in all of the quizzes in the current
    directory.

    \filbreak

    \subsubsection{Breadcrumbs}\label{SS:breadcrumbs}\index{breadcrumbs}
    \WebQuiz provides a straightforward way to place navigation breadcrumbs
    at the top of the quiz web page. By default the
    breadcrumbs are disabled. Adding \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs| command
    like\footnote{In a web browser all of the parts of the breadcrumbs
    have the same height. In contrast, in this manual the ``Quizzes''
    breadcrumb is slightly fatter than the other crumbs. This is an
    unfortunate artefact of how the images are generated for the
    manual.}:
    \begin{latexcode}
        \BreadCrumbs{Mathematics /|Math1001 /u/Math1001|quizindex|title}
    \end{latexcode}
    adds the following breadcrumbs, or navigation links, to the top of
    the quiz page:
    \ScreenShot{Example breadcrumbs}{breadcrumbs}
    The breadcrumbs are typically navigation links. In this example:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item In the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs|, the \BashCode|Mathematics /| inserts the text
      \BashCode|Mathematics| as the first crumb with (relative) URL
      \BashCode|/|, the root directory for the web
      server, which is often the correct URL for the department (or the
      institution)
      \item The \BashCode|Math101 /u/math101| inserts the text
      \BashCode|Math101| as the second breadcrumb with URL
      \BashCode|/u/math101|.
      \item The \BashCode|quizindex| inserts the text \BashCode|Quizzes|
      together with the symbol $\equiv$, which opens a drop-down menu
      that contains the list of quizzes in the quiz index for the unit.
      This is described in more detail below.
      \item Finally the \LatexCode|title| in the breadcrumbs inserts, as
      text, the part of the title before the first colon in the title,
      where the title is given by \LatexCode|\title{...}|.
    \end{itemize}
    The breadcrumbs for the quiz web page can be either be configured
    quiz-by-quiz, using the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs| macro
    \macroIndex{BreadCrumbs} as above, or by setting a default for the
    \LatexCode|breadcrumbs|  in the \webquizrc file using the
    command-line option
    \begin{bashcode}
      > webquiz --edit-settings
    \end{bashcode}
    as described in \autoref{SS:commandline}. Breadcrumbs are disabled by default.

    The breadcrumbs inside the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs{...}| command are given as
    a ``|-separated list''. For example, quite reasonable breadcrumbs are given by:
    \begin{latexcode}
      \BreadCrumbs{ department | unitcode | quizindex | title }
    \end{latexcode}
    To make this the default set of breadcrumbs use
    \BashCode{webquiz --edit-settings} to set breadcrumbs
    in the \webquizrc file to:
    \begin{latexcode}
       department | unitcode | quizindex | title
    \end{latexcode}
    More generally, the breadcrumbs can be specified as:
    \begin{latexcode}
      \BreadCrumbs{ crumb1 | crumb2 | crumb3 | crumb4 | ...  }
    \end{latexcode}
    In principle, there can be arbitrarily many crumbs in your
    breadcrumbs but, in practice, five is more than enough.
    The crumbs inside a \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs| command are interpreted as follows:

    \begin{description}
      \item[breadcrumb] The breadcrumb for the current quiz, which is
      set using the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumb| macro.  This breadcrumb is
      purely descriptive, with no hyperlink being added and only the text given by
      \LatexCode|\BreadCrumb| appearing.
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}*{breadcrumb}

      \item[department] This expands to a link to your department, where
      the department text is set using the macro \LatexCode|\Department| and its URL is set by
      \LatexCode|\DepartmentURL|.
      \macroIndex{Department}\macroIndex{DepartmentURL}
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}{department}

      \item[institution] This expands to a link to your institution, where
      the institution text is set using \LatexCode|\Institution| and its URL is set by
      \LatexCode|\InstitutionURL|. The institution also appears in the
      side-menu above the \WebQuiz copyright notice.
      \macroIndex{Institution}\macroIndex{InstitutionURL}
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}{institution}

      \item[quizindex] This expands to \BashCode|Quizzes|, which is a
      link to the index page for your unit, as defined by
      \LatexCode|\QuizzesURL|, which is described below.
      In addition, if the directory contains an
      index file (see \autoref{SS:index}), then the symbol
      {\large$\equiv$} will appear, giving access to a drop-down menu to
      the index page. The drop-down menu created by the
      \LatexCode|quizindex| environment looks like this:
      \ScreenShot{Drop-down menu giving index of quizzes}{dropdown}
      \macroIndex{QuizzesURL}
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}{quizindex} This drop-down menu will only
      appear as soon as a \WebQuiz \LatexCode|quizindex| environment has
      been compiles in the current directory.
      \CrossIndex{breadcrumbs}{quizindex}.

      For those interested in how this is done, whenever \WebQuiz
      compiles a \LatexCode|quizindex| environment it creates a
      \Javascript file \BashCode|quizindex.js|. Every quiz file includes
      this \Javascript file, if it exists, and this allows it to display
      a drop-down menu for the quiz index.

      \item[Title] This expands to the full title of the quiz page,
      without a hyperlink, as given by the \LatexCode|\title|.
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}*{Title}

      \item[title] This expands to the part of title of the quiz page,
      without a hyperlink, as given by the \LatexCode|\title| command.
      That is, this expands to print the part of the title
      \textit{before} the first colon ``:'' in the title. So, for
      example, if the title is ``Quiz 1: The wonders of life'' then
      ``Quiz 1'' will be added to the list of breadcrumbs. If the title
      does not contain a colon then the complete title is printed.
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}*{title}

      \item[unitcode] This expands to a link to the unit code, where the
      unit code text is set using \LatexCode|\UnitCode|, and its URL is
      set by
      \LatexCode|\UnitURL|
      \macroIndex{UnitCode}\macroIndex{UnitURL}
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}{unitcode}

      \item[unitname] This expands to a link to the unit name, where the
      unit name text is set using \LatexCode|\UnitName|, and its URL is
      set by
      \LatexCode|\UnitURL|
      \macroIndex{UnitName}\macroIndex{UnitURL}
      \CrossIndex*{BreadCrumb}{unitname}

    \end{description}

    \noindent
    In addition, each \textit{crumb} in a breadcrumb, except for the
    ``magic crumbs'' listed above, is allowed to be arbitrary text ---
    although, non-ascii characters may cause probnlems. In this case, the
    last ``word'' in the crumb is treated as a URL if it either beings
    with a backslash, $\backslash$, or if it begins with
    \BashCode|http|.  For example, the code:
    \InputLatexCode{montypython}
    \noindent
    results in the following breadcrumbs:
    \ScreenShot{Guaranteed to offend some one}{montypython}
    Notice that it is necessary to correctly escape spaces etc in
    URLs that are specified this way. Similarly, all of the characters
    in the breadcrumbs should be ascii characters as unicode is like to
    cause encoding issues (see the Czech index given in
    \autoref{SS:index}).

    If any part of a ``magic'' breadcrumb has not been defined then it
    is printed with question marks on the web page. For example, the quiz
    file
    \InputLatexCode{nounits}
    does not define the unit code, so it results in the ``bad'' breadcrumbs:
    \ScreenShot{Breadcrumbs with no unit code}{nounits}

    Finally, here is the list of \WebQuiz commands that can be used to
    specify the contents of the breadcrumbs. Default values for many of these
    ``crumbs'' can be given in the \webquizrc file; see \autoref{SS:rcfile}.

    \newcommand\Item[1]{\item[\textbackslash#1]\CrossIndex{breadcrumbs}*{#1}}
  \begin{description}
    \Item{BreadCrumb}\macroIndex{BreadCrumb}
      The \LatexCode|\BreadCrumb| command sets the \LatexCode|breadcrumb|
      variable in the \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs|. The primary use for this
      is when you have default breadcrumbs in the \webquizrc file like
      \begin{bashcode}
          breadcrumbs = department | unitcode | breadcrumb
      \end{bashcode}
      Using \LatexCode|\BreadCrumb| allows you to set the last crumb to
      some meaningful text that describes the quiz.

    \Item{Department}\macroIndex{Department}
      The \LatexCode|\Department| command sets the name of the
      \LatexCode|department|. As described earlier in this section, by
      default, the \LatexCode|department| is the first item in the
      breadcrumbs that appear at the top of the web page.

      The default department can be set in the \webquizrc file using
      \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

      Default value: \BashCode{''} \qquad(i.e. the empty string)

    \Item{DepartmentURL}\macroIndex{DepartmentURL}
      The \LatexCode|\DepartmentURL| command sets URL for the department. As
      described earlier in this section, by default the department URL is
      the link in the first breadcrumb on each web page.

      The default department URL can be set in the \webquizrc file using
      \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

      Default value: \DefaultValue{/}

      \Item{Institution}\macroIndex{Institution}
      The \LatexCode|\Institution| command sets the institution, or university.
      The \LatexCode|institution| appears below the question buttons in the
      left-hand navigation menu that appears on every quiz web page
      (provided that the screen size is not too small).  As described
      earlier in this section, the institution can be used in the web
      page breadcrumbs.

      The default institution can be set in the \webquizrc file using
      \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

      Default value: \BashCode{''} \qquad(i.e. the empty string)


      \Item{InstitutionURL}\macroIndex{InstitutionURL}
      The \LatexCode|\InstitutionURL| command sets the institution URL. This is
      used as the link for the \LatexCode|institution| in the left-hand
      navigation menu that appears on every quiz page.  As described
      earlier in this section, the institution URL can be used in the
      web page breadcrumbs.

      The default institution URL can be set in the \webquizrc file using
      \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

      Default value: \DefaultValue{/}

      \Item{QuizzesURL}\macroIndex{QuizzesURL}
      The \LatexCode|\QuizzesURL| command sets the URL for the suite of quizzes
      attached to this unit of study. As described earlier in this
      section, this can be used in the breadcrumb at the top of the quiz
      web page.

      Default value:  \DefaultValue{UnitURL/Quizzes}, where \DefaultValue{UnitURL} is set
      using \LatexCode|\UnitURL|

      \Item{UnitCode}\macroIndex{UnitCode}
      The \LatexCode|\UnitCode| command sets the unit of study code for the
      unit that the quiz is part of.

      \Item{UnitName}\macroIndex{UnitName}
      The \LatexCode|\UnitName| command sets the name of the unit of study for
      the unit that the quiz is attached to.

      \Item{UnitURL}\macroIndex{UnitURL}
      The \LatexCode|\UnitURL| command sets the URL for the unit of study code
      for the unit that the quiz is attached to.

  \end{description}

  It makes sense to set defaults for \LatexCode|\BreadCrumbs|
  \LatexCode|\Department|, \LatexCode|\DepartmentURL|,
  \LatexCode|\Institution| and \LatexCode|\InstitutionURL| in the
  \webquizrc. After doing this, a typical \WebQuiz file might look like this:

  \begin{latexcode}
    \documentclass{webquiz}
    \UnitName{Fundamental stuff}
    \UnitCode{Stuff101}
    \UnitURL{/courses/stuff101}

    \title{Stuffing: the art of taxidermy}

    \begin{document}
      \begin{question}
        first question...
      \end{question}
      \begin{question}
        second question...
      \end{question}
    \end{document}
  \end{latexcode}

  If you have many quizzes for many different units then a better approach is to create
  a \LaTeX{} ``package'', say \BashCode|ourunits.sty|, to set these variables:
  \begin{latexcode}
    % ourunits.sty - set unit names, codes and URLs
    \DeclareOption{stuff101}{
      \UnitName{Fundamental stuff}
      \UnitCode{Stuff101}
      \UnitURL{/courses/stuff101}
    }
    \DeclareOption{stuff102}{
      \UnitName{Fundamental stuff too}
      \UnitCode{Stuff102}
      \UnitURL{/courses/stuff102}
    }
    \ProcessOptions
    \endinput
  \end{latexcode}
  Then you can replace the opening lines of the quiz file with
  \LatexCode|\usepackage[stuff101]{ourunits}|.

  \subsection{WebQuiz document class options}\label{SS:classOptions}

    The \WebQuiz document class supports the following document
    class options:
    \begin{latexcode}
      fixedorder, hidesidemenu, language, onepage, pst2pdf,
      separatepages, showsidemenu, theme, tikz
    \end{latexcode}
    This section describes all of these document-class options except for
    \ctan{tikz} and \ctan{pst2pdf}, which are discussed in
    \autoref{SS:graphics}. Many of the document-class options below occur
    in pairs and defaults for all of them can be set in the \webquizrc
    file; see \autoref{SS:rcfile}. The settings given in the \LaTeX{} file
    for the quiz override the default settings in the \webquizrc file.

  \begin{description}
    \item[fixedorder, randomorder]
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{fixedorder}
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{randomorder}
      By default, the questions in the quiz are displayed in a
      \DefaultValue{fixedorder} for all students who take the quiz,
      which is the order that they appear in the \LaTeX{} file for the
      quiz. That is, question~1 is the first question appearing in the
      \LaTeX file,m question~2 is the second question and so on. With
      the \LatexCode|randomorder| option the questions in the quiz are
      displayed in a random order that changes each time that the quiz
      is run, and so the questions are generally in a different order
      for every student. For example, the code:
      \InputLatexCode{random}
      produces the quiz with randomly arranged quiz questions:
      \ScreenShot{Randomly ordered questions}{random}
      When using the \LatexCode|randomorder| document-class option only
      the questions appear in random order. If the quiz contains multiple
      choice questions then the choices are \textit{not} randomly
      permuted. That is, the choices always appear in the order that they
      are written in the \LaTeX{} file.

    \item[sidemenu, hidesidemenu]
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{hidesidemenu}
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{showsidemenu}
      If this option is set the end the side menu is not displayed
      initially. By default, the side menu appears unless the screen size
      is too small, such as on a mobile phone. Many examples of the
      \LatexCode|hidesidemenu| and \LatexCode|showsidemenu| class options
      can be found above above.

      The side menu automatics disappears on small devices, such as
      mobile phones.  The display of the side menu can is also toggled
      by clicking on the {\textcolor{red}{\XSolidBold}} and
      {\textcolor{red}{\ding{118}}} symbols.

    \item[onepage, separatepages]
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{onepage}
    \CrossIndex{document class options}{separatepages}
    By default, only one question, or discussion environment, is displayed
    by the quiz at any time. As \LatexCode|separatepages| is the default, every
    example so far is of this form. With the document-class option
    \LatexCode|onepage| all questions, and discussion environments, are
    displayed at the same time. So, for example, the code:
    \InputLatexCode{onepage}
    produces the quiz page:
    \ScreenShot{A one page quiz}{onepage}

    \item[language=<lang>] \CrossIndex{document class options}{language}
    Set the language used by the \textit{webpages} constructed by \WebQuiz.
    The following languages are currently supported by \WebQuiz:
      \begin{quote}
          \input{webquiz.languages}
      \end{quote}
    The languages files are used to print the various buttons and text
    that is generated on the web pages constructed by \WebQuiz. The
    \LatexCode|language| option does not affect the DVI or
    \BashCode|PDF| versions of the quiz and it does not load language
    packages like \ctan{babel} or \ctan{polyglossia}.

    Typical usage of the \LatexCode|language| option is the following:
    \lstinputlisting[style=latexcode,extendedchars=false]{examples/french}
    This produces a web page like this:
    \ScreenShot{A web page with \textsf{language=french}}{french}
    As a general rule, \LaTeX{} and \TeXfht do not cope well with
    unicode characters, so if your quiz contains (a lot of) unicode
    characters then we recommend using Xe\LaTeX{} or Lau\LaTeX, which
    corresponds to using \WebQuiz with the command-line options
    \BashCode|webquiz -x| or \BashCode|webquiz -l|, respectively. The
    default \TeX{} engine can be set in the \webquizrc file; see
    \autoref{SS:rcfile} for more details.
    \index{unicode}\index{lualatex}\index{xelatex}

    The language files were created largely using google translate so
    they may well need fine-tuning\footnote{For example, the word
    ``Copyright'' in left-hand the side-margin is not translated but
    perhaps it should be.}. You can use \BashCode|kpsewhich| to look at
    the language files, which all have names of the form
    \BashCode|webquiz-language.lang|.  For example, the
    \textit{English} language file, which is the default, can be found
    using the command:
    \begin{bashcode}
         > kpsewhich webquiz-english.lang
    \end{bashcode}
    This file contains the following:
    \InputBashCode{webquiz-english.lang}
    In these files, the material to the left of the equals signs are
    effectively variables, and so they should never be changed, or
    deleted, whereas anything to the right of the equals signs is the text
    that is will appear on the \WebQuiz web pages. To add \WebQuiz support
    for a new language, say language \LatexCode|XXX|, copy any \WebQuiz language
    file and translate the material to the right of the equals signs and
    then save the file as \BashCode|webquiz-XXX.lang|, and then put this
    file anywhere in the \LaTeX{} search path. Note that the expressions
    \LatexCode|{}| in the language files should be not be removed
    because they expand to expressions like \LatexCode|(a)|, \LatexCode|(b)|
    etc. when used in the on-line quizzes. Once the new language file
    \BashCode|webquiz-XXX.lang| is in the \LaTeX{} search
    path\footnote{For example, if you are using \TeX Live then you will
    need to run \BashCode|mktexlsr| as an administrator.} it can be
    used by \WebQuiz using \LatexCode|language=XXX| as a document-class
    option:
    \begin{latexcode}
       \documentclass[language=XXX]{webquiz}
       \begin{document}
            insert quiz code
       \end{document}
    \end{latexcode}
    Please submit any new language files, or corrections to existing
    language files, as a \textit{new issue} at:
      \href{https://\webquiz{repository}}{\webquiz{repository}}.

    \item[theme]\CrossIndex{document class options}{theme}

       \WebQuiz\ has a small number of different themes for setting the
       colours on the quiz web pages. The theme can be set as an option to
       the document class or in the \webquizrc file. Most of the examples
       so far have used the \LatexCode|default| theme. As
       an example, if we use:
      \InputLatexCode{choice-dark}
      then the quiz page looks like:
      \ScreenShot{Multiple choice with light theme}{choice-dark}
      This should be compared with the corresponding screenshot in section
      \autoref{SS:choice}, which uses the default theme.

      \WebQuiz currently supports the following themes:
        \begin{quote}
            \input{webquiz.themes}
        \end{quote}
      Screenshots for the complete list of themes can be found in
      \hyperref[SS:themes]{Appendix A}.

  \subsection{Including graphics and using pstricks and
  tikz}\label{SS:graphics} It is also possible to include complicated
  diagrams in \WebQuiz quizzes using packages like \ctan{tikz} and
  \ctan{pstricks}.  As there have been several recent updates it is
  advisable to install the latest version of both of these packages, as
  well as the packages \ctan{make4ht}, \ctan{pgf} and \TeXfht. In fact,
  it is recommended that you update all of your \TeX{} packages.

  By far the easiest way to include images when using \WebQuiz is by
  adding the following lines to your document preamble:
  \begin{latexcode}
      \usepackage[dvipdfmx]{graphicx}
      \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png}
  \end{latexcode}
  to your document preamble. You need to use
  \LatexCode|\DeclareGraphicsExtensions| to tell \WebQuiz the different
  types of images you are using, so the code above works for
  \LatexCode{png} images. More generally, you can use a comma separated
  list of extensions, such as:
  \begin{latexcode}
    \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.png, .jpg, .gif}
  \end{latexcode}
  The option \LatexCode|dvipdfmx|
  to \LatexCode|graphicx| is only necessary if you want to be able to
  rescale images. For example, the code:
      \InputLatexCode{lion-image}
  produces the quiz page:
  \ScreenShot{Including a lion}{lion-image}

  Using \ctan{pstricks} is often just as easy, such as the following
  code that works out of the box:
    \InputLatexCode{pstricks-ex}
  to produce the web page:
    \ScreenShot{Pstricks example}{pstricks-ex}

  Even though \ctan{tikz} and \ctan{pstricks} can be used in \WebQuiz
  quizzes, both of these packages sometimes have problems. WebQuiz tries
  to solve some these problems for you if you use the
  \LatexCode|pst2pdf| or \LatexCode|tikz| document-class options, which
  we now describe.

  \begin{description}
      \item[pst2pdf] \index{pstricks}\CrossIndex{document class options}{pst2pdf}

      For the most part, \ctan{pstricks} drawings display correctly.
      When they do fail they can sometimes be salvaged using
      \ctan{pst2pdf}. Applying \ctan{pst2pdf} to a \WebQuiz quiz is not
      completely straightforward, so \WebQuiz provides the
      document-class option \ctan{pst2pdf} to automatically apply
      \ctan{pst2pdf} as part of the quiz web page build process. If your
      \ctan{pstricks} drawings do not display correctly it is worthwhile
      to see if \ctan{pst2pdf} fixes the problems.

      For example, the following quiz compiles only with the
      \ctan{pst2pdf} document-class option:
      \InputLatexCode{pst2pdf}
      to produce the quiz:
      \ScreenShot{Example requiring the pst2pdf document class
      option}{pst2pdf} The placement of the image is still not quite
      perfect, although this adjusts with the screen size and it does,
      in fact, displays well on a mobile device.  More importantly, if
      you use the \LatexCode|pst2pdf| document-class option then
      \WebQuiz is able to display this image.

      \noindent
      Unfortunately, \ctan{pst2pdf} can fail silently without giving any
      warnings. If you plan to use the \LatexCode|pst2pdf|
      document-class option then you should first check to make
      that it is properly installed. According to the \ctan{pst2pdf}
      manual:

      \begin{dangerous}
        \ctan{pst2pdf} needs Ghostscript (>=9.14), perl (>=5.18), pdf2svg, pdftoppm
        and pdftops (from poppler-utils or xpdf-utils) to process a file
        using \ctan{pst2pdf}.
      \end{dangerous}

      If using \ctan{pst2pdf} does not produce an image then, rather
      than \ctan{pst2pdf} not working, the problem might be that you
      have not installed all of the programs that \ctan{pst2pdf} relies
      upon, so look in your log files for error messages and check that
      all of the programs listed above are correctly installed, with the
      specified version numbers. See also \autoref{SS:pstricks}.

    \item[tikz]\CrossIndex{document class options}{tikz}
      Giving this class option both loads the \ctan[pgf]{tikz} package
      (use the document-class option \ctan{tikz}, and not
      \LatexCode|\usepackage{tikz}|, in your \LaTeX\ file). As a bonus,
      this \ctan{tikz} document option fixes several issues with PGF that
      prevent it from working with \TeXfht. Thanks are due to Michal
      Hoftich for supplying both fixes!\footnote{The first issue is a bug
      that was fixed by the PGF developers only in 2019.  The second issue is that
      PGF hard codes \BashCode|ISO-8859-1| encoding, which is a problem
      since \WebQuiz uses UTF-8; see
      \href{https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/390421}{tex.stackexchange.com/questions/390421}
      for more details.}
      \InputLatexCode{tikz-ex}
      This produces:
      \ScreenShot{Tikz example}{tikz-ex}
  \end{description}

  Most people use either \ctan{pstricks} or \ctan{tikz}. A quiz that
  tries to use both \ctan{pstricks} and  \ctan{tikz} will probably not
  compile.

  \subsection{Configuring commands and environments for
  \TeXfht}\label{SS:config}\macroIndex{DisplayAsImage}

      The underlying engine used by \WebQuiz is \TeXfht so, because
      \TeXfht is not able process all \LaTeX{} code, there is \LaTeX{}
      code that \WebQuiz is not able to cope with.  This said, \TeXfht is
      able to display \textit{most} \LaTeX{} code and \WebQuiz has been
      used to write literally thousands of quiz questions so it is likely
      that you will be able to typeset what you want in your on-line
      quizzes.  In particular, it is possible to use \ctan[pgf]{tikz} and
      \ctan{pstricks} in \WebQuiz quizzes, although complicated
      drawings with these packages may fail; see \autoref{SS:graphics} for
      more details.

    \WebQuiz uses \TeXfht{} to convert the quiz content from \LaTeX{} to
    \HTML. If \TeXfht{} has not been configured to for some of the
    commands or environments that you are using then they may not
    display correctly in your on-line quizzes. The ``correct'' way to
    fix such problems is to write appropriate \TeXfht{} configuration
    commands, however, this can be tricky to do --- especially if you
    are not familiar with the inner workings of \TeX{} and \TeXfht.

    As a workaround, \WebQuiz provides the command \LatexCode|\DisplayAsImage|, which essentially
    tells \TeXfht to treat your command as an image when it creates the
    web page. This is an easy work-around that is much easier than writing
    your own \TeXfht configuration commands and it often produces good
    results.

    For example, the \ctan{mhchem} package is a powerful package
    that defines a macro \LatexCode{\ce} for writing chemical symbols but,
    unfortunately, the \LatexCode{\ce} macro has not (yet) been configured
    to work with \TeXfht, which means that this command does not work in
    \WebQuiz quizzes.  Putting the command \LatexCode{\DisplayAsImage{ce}}
    into your preamble fixes this and allows to you to produce quizzes
    using \LatexCode{\ce}. As a result, you can produce the quiz
    \ScreenShot{Using DisplayAsImage}{display-as-image}
    using the code:
    \InputLatexCode{display-as-image}
    As the example code shows, \LatexCode|\DisplayAsImage| accepts an optional
    argument that can be used to fine-tune the placement of the image on
    the quiz web page. For those interested in the technical details, the
    definition of \LatexCode|\DisplayAsImage| is:
    \begin{latexcode}
      \RequirePackage{etoolbox}
      \renewcommand\DisplayAsImage[2][]{%
        \csletcs{real:#2}{#2}%
        \NewConfigure{#2}{2}
        \csdef{#2}##1{\Picture+[#1]{}\csuse{real:#2}{##1}\EndPicture}
        \Configure{#2}{\Picture+[#1]{}}{\EndPicture}
      }
    \end{latexcode}

  \section{System requirements, installation and configuration}
    \label{S:configuration}
    \index{system requirements}
    \CrossIndex{system requirements}{tex4ht}
    \CrossIndex{system requirements}{make4ht}
    \CrossIndex{system requirements}{python}

      \WebQuiz takes a \LaTeX\ file and translates it into a functional
      web page. To use \WebQuiz the quiz author only needs to know how to
      use \LaTeX\ \textit{and} to have all of the programs used by \WebQuiz
      installed. Fortunately, most of the system requirements will already
      be installed on a system with an up-to-date installation of
      \TeXLive, however, some tweaking may still be necessary.

      Behind the scenes, \WebQuiz uses \TeXfht, \python, \Javascript and
      several other tools to construct and operate the on-line quizzes.
      The \WebQuiz program has three main components:
        \begin{itemize}
             \item \LaTeX\ files (a class file and \TeXfht configuration files)
             \item Python3 executables that use \TeXfht to convert \LaTeX\
             files into web pages
             \item Web files (\Javascript, \CSS and on-line documentation)
            %\item Documentation
        \end{itemize}
      Of course, to use the on-line quizzes created by \WebQuiz you
      need a web server. To use \WebQuiz all of these files need to
      be in appropriate places.  Fortunately, \Ctan takes care of
      most of this but the web-related files still need to be put onto
      your web server.

      \WebQuiz has been tested extensively on Linux and Mac operating
      systems. Several people have used \WebQuiz on windows computers,
      but I have not tested the program on a windows computer myself.

      \subsection{System requirements}\index{system requirements}

      In order to work \WebQuiz needs the following programs to be
      installed on your system:
      \begin{itemize}
         \item An up-to-date \LaTeX{} distribution, such as that provided
         by \TeXLive. In particular, you need to have \TeXfht{} and
         \ctan{make4ht} installed.

         Unfortunately, the version of \ctan{make4ht} that was released
         with \TeXLive{} 2018 had some bugs and there have been many
         recent changes to \ctan{make4ht} and \ctan{pstricks},
         so it is strongly recommended that you update all packages
         from \Ctan before you try and use \WebQuiz.

          \item \python[Python 3]. As of writing python 3.7.2 is available.
          \item \Javascript
          \item If your quizzes use \ctan{pstricks}, or if you want to
          compile the \OnlineManual, then you need to ensure that
          \href{https://www.ghostscript.com/}{Ghostscript} and
          \ctan{dvisvgm} are installed and properly configured; see
          \autoref{SS:pstricks} for more details.
          \item A web server. As detailed in \autoref{SS:Initialise}, you
          will need to install the web components of \WebQuiz.
      \end{itemize}

      \subsection{Initialising \WebQuiz}\label{SS:Initialise}
      \CrossIndex{command-line options}{initialise}
      \index{installation}\index{initialisation}

      \WebQuiz is a tool for creating on-line quizzes and in order for
      it to work efficiently various files
      (\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript}{javascript} and
      \href{https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_intro.asp}{cascading style
      sheets}) need to put onto your web server. \WebQuiz has an
      \textit{initialisation} routine for installing the web components
      of the program. In fact, until \WebQuiz has been initialised it
      will ask you if you to run the initialisation routine every time
      you use \WebQuiz. You can reinitialise \WebQuiz at any time using
      the command-line option:
      \begin{bashcode}
        > webquiz --initialise
      \end{bashcode}
      \WebQuiz will actually work without being initialised, however, any
      quiz web pages that are created before initialisation will be
      emblazoned with a message reminding you to initialise \WebQuiz.

      \textit{If you want to install the \WebQuiz files for general use on
      your system, or to save system wide settings, then you need to run
      the initialisation command }\BashCode|webquiz --initialise|
      \textit{using an administrator account or using \BashCode|sudo| on a
      UNIX or Mac OSX system.}

      The location of the files on the web server depends both on the
      operating system that is running on your computer and how your web
      server has been configured. It is essential that the \WebQuiz files
      are installed in a directory that is accessible from the web. It
      does not matter if they are put into a user web directory or into a
      system web directory.  If necessary please consult your system
      administrator.

      Common locations for the \textit{web root} of the server are:
      \begin{center}
        \begin{tabular}{ll}
          \toprule
          Operating system & Root of web server \\\midrule
          Mac OSX     & \BashCode|/Library/WebServer/Documents|\\
          Linux       & \BashCode|/var/www/html|\\
          Windows     & \BashCode|C:\inetpub\wwwroot|\\
          \bottomrule
        \end{tabular}
      \end{center}
      \WebQuiz needs to copy several files into a subdirectory of this
      \textit{web root}. When you run
      \begin{bashcode}
        > webquiz --initialise
      \end{bashcode}
      you will be prompted for the following:
      \begin{itemize}
        \item The location of the \WebQuiz web directory, which needs to
        be a directory that is visible to your web server
        \item The relative URL for this directory, which tells your web
        browser where to find these files
      \end{itemize}
      For example, on my system the web root for our web server is
      \BashCode|/usr/local/httpd/| and the \WebQuiz web files are in
      the directory \BashCode|/usr/local/httpd/UoS/WebQuiz|.  So, I set:
      \begin{quote}
        \begin{tabular}{lll} \WebQuiz web
              directory &=& \BashCode|/usr/local/httpd/UoS/WebQuiz|\\
              \WebQuiz relative URL  &=& \BashCode|/UoS/WebQuiz|
          \end{tabular}
      \end{quote}
      Once the initialisation step is complete, \WebQuiz is ready to use!
      You can test your \WebQuiz installation by compiling the example
      files from the \WebQuiz manual. You can find these files in the
      directory \BashCode|web_root/doc/examples|, where the
      \BashCode|web_root| is the directory where you just installed
      \WebQuiz web files. If
      \href{https://www.ghostscript.com/}{Ghostscript} and \ctan{dvisvgm}
      are installed and properly configured (see \autoref{SS:graphics})
      then you should also be able to compile the \OnlineManual using
      \WebQuiz.

      \begin{heading}[Remark]
        To remove all \WebQuiz files from your web server use
        \begin{bashcode}
            > webquiz --uninstall
        \end{bashcode}
      \end{heading}

      Once \WebQuiz is initialised you may also want to run:
      \begin{bashcode}
         > webquiz --edit-settings
      \end{bashcode}
      This allows you to set various system defaults for the quizzes that,
      for example, specify the name and URL for your department and
      institution as well as the default language and theme used for the
      quizzes. All of these defaults can be overridden in any \LaTeX\ file
      for a quiz.

      When changing the settings \WebQuiz tries to explain what it is
      doing at each step. When you run \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|
      you will be prompted for the following:
      \begin{description}[nosep, labelwidth=18ex]
        \item[breadcrumbs] breadcrumbs at the top of quiz page (\autoref{SS:breadcrumbs})
        \item[department] name of department (\autoref{SS:breadcrumbs})
        \item[department-url] url for department (\autoref{SS:breadcrumbs})
        \item[engine] default tex engine used to compile web pages (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[hide-side-menu] do not display the side menu at start of quiz
              (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[institution] institution or university (\autoref{SS:breadcrumbs})
        \item[institution-url] url for institution or university (\autoref{SS:breadcrumbs})
        \item[language] default language used on web pages (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[one-page] display questions on one page (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[random-order] randomly order the quiz questions (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[theme] default colour theme used on web pages (\autoref{SS:classOptions})
        \item[version] webquiz version number for webquizrc settings
                    (\autoref{SS:rcfile})
        \item[webquiz-url] relative url for webquiz web directory (\autoref{SS:Initialise})
        \item[webquiz-www] full path to webquiz web directory (\autoref{SS:Initialise})
        \item[make4ht] build file for make4ht (\autoref{SS:Initialise})
        \item[mathjax] url for mathjax (\autoref{SS:Initialise})
        \item[webquiz-layout] name of \python module that formats the quizzes
        (\autoref{SS:layout})
      \end{description}
      The last three options are \textit{advanced options} that you probably do not
      want to change. For more details see \autoref{SS:rcfile}, which
      describes the \webquizrc file.  The default values of all of these
      settings can be overridden in the \LaTeX{} file for the  quiz and
      the default values can be changed at any time using
      \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

       When changing the settings for \WebQuiz if you are unsure what
       a particular setting does then \textit{press return} to accept
       the default value --- the default value is printed
       inside square brackets as \BashCode|[default]|. In particular, you
       are strongly recommended to accept the default values for all of
       the advanced options because it is very unlikely that you will need
       to change these when you first use \WebQuiz.

       \subsection{Graphics and \ctan{dvisvgm}}
      \label{SS:pstricks}

  \index{pstricks}
  \noindent
  \WebQuiz, via \TeXfht, uses \ctan{dvisvgm} to convert certain images to
  \href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalable_Vector_Graphics}{Scalable
  Vector Graphics} (SVG). This is done using his is done
  using \ctan{dvisvgm}. At first sight this is OK because \ctan{dvisvgm} is
  included in \TeXLive and Mik\TeX, however, \ctan{dvisvgm} uses
  \href{https://www.ghostscript.com/}{Ghostscript} and this needs to be
  correctly configured and, as outlined in
  \href{http://dvisvgm.bplaced.net/FAQ}{FAQ}, \ctan{dvisvgm} needs to know
  where to find the \href{https://www.ghostscript.com/}{Ghostscript}
  libraries. For example, to get \ctan{dvisvgm} to work on my system I
  needed to add the line
  \begin{bashcode}
    export LIBGS=/usr/local/lib/libgs.dylib
  \end{bashcode}
  to my \BashCode|.bashrc| file. To see whether you need to do something
  similar on your system you nee to look at the output from the following
  two commands:

    \begin{bashcode}
      > dvisvgm -h
      > dvisvgm -l
    \end{bashcode}

  \noindent There are three possibilities:

    \begin{itemize}
      \item the \BashCode|-h| output does not contain \BashCode|-libgs|
      and the \BashCode|-l| output contains \BashCode|ps|:
      ghostscript was linked at build time, so everything should work
      \item
      the \BashCode|-h| output contains \BashCode|-libgs| and the
      \BashCode|-l| output does not contain \BashCode|ps|:
      gpostscript support is enabled but ghostscript is not linked. You
      need to locate the ghostscript library
      \BashCode|libgs.so| or \BashCode|libgs.dylib| on your system and set
      the \BashCode|LIBGS| environment variable, or equivalent,
      accordingly
      \item the \BashCode|-h| output does not contain \BashCode|-libgs|
      and the \BashCode|-l| output does not contain \BashCode|ps|:
      \ctan{dvisvgm} was not built with postscript support. In this
      case, \WebQuiz will not be able to process \ctan{svg} images. You
      need to reinstall \ctan{dvisvgm} with ghostscript support.
    \end{itemize}

  \section{The WebQuiz program} \index{usage}

      The \WebQuiz program was designed to be run from the command-line,
      so to process the file \BashCode|quiz.tex| using \WebQuiz type:
      \begin{bashcode}
        > webquiz quiz          or          > webquiz > quiz.tex
      \end{bashcode}
      One feature of \WebQuiz is that you can process more than one
      quiz file at a time. For example, if you have quiz files
      \BashCode|quiz1.tex|, ..., \BashCode|quiz9.tex| in the current directory
      then, on a UNIX system, you can rebuild the web pages for all of
      these quizzes using the single command:
      \begin{bashcode}
        > webquiz quiz[1-9].tex
      \end{bashcode}
      This is useful if some generic aspect of all of the quizzes has
      changed, such as breadcrumbs or a department URL. In fact, one
      would probably use
      \begin{bashcode}
        > webquiz -qq quiz[1-9].tex
      \end{bashcode}
      because the \BashCode|webquiz --qq| command-line option suppresses
      almost all of the output produced by \LaTeX\ and \TeXfht. The next
      section discusses the \WebQuiz command-line options.

      \subsection{Command-line options}\label{SS:commandline}
      \index{command-line options}
      \InputBashCode{webquiz.usage}
      The command-line options are listed on separate lines to
      improve readability but they can appear in any order when you use
      them provided that they are all on the same line. We group the
      command-line options by their functionality in order to describe
      them.

      \begin{description}
         \item[-h, --help] \CrossIndex{command-line options}{help}
            list the command-line options and exit

         \item[-q, -qq, \ddash quiet] \CrossIndex{command-line options}{quiet mode}
         Suppress tex4ht messages: \BashCode|-q| is quiet and
         \BashCode|-qq| is  very quiet. If you use
         \BashCode|webquiz -qq texfile.tex| then almost no output will
         be printed by \WebQuiz when it is processing your quiz file. Be
         warned, however, that both of these options can make it harder to find and fix
         errors, so using the \BashCode|-q| and \BashCode|-qq| options is not
         recommended if your file is not compiling.

         \end{description}

         \subsubsection*{\TeX{} options}

         \begin{description}

         \item[-d, \ddash draft] draft mode. The \LaTeX file is processed
         only once by \BashCode|htlatex|, which gives a much faster
         compilation time but cross references etc may not be completely
         up to date. This is equivalent to using
         \BashCode|make4ht --mode draft|
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{draft mode}

         \item[-s,\ddash shell-escape] Shell escape for htlatex/make4ht
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{shell-escape}

         \item[-l,\ddash lua] Use lua\LaTeX{} to compile the quiz
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{lua}

         \item[\ddash latex] Use \LaTeX{} to compile the quiz
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{lua}

         \item[-x, \ddash xelatex] Use xe\LaTeX{} to compile the quiz
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{xelatex}
         \index{xelatex}

         \end{description}

         \subsubsection*{\WebQuiz settings and configuration}

         \begin{description}

         \item[-i, \ddash initialise] \CrossIndex{command-line options}{initialise}
            Initialise files and settings for webquiz. The command
            \BashCode|webquiz --initialise| should be run before using
            \WebQuiz. This command will help you to copy the web files needed by
            \WebQuiz into the directories used by your web server. See
            \autoref{S:configuration} for more details.

         \item[\ddash edit-settings] \CrossIndex{command-line options}{edit-settings}
            Edit the webquiz settings in the rc-file. The settings that
            are marked as advanced should be changed only with care. To
            change the settings for \BashCode|webquiz-www| and \BashCode|webquiz-url|
            use: \BashCode|webquiz --initialise|.

         \item[\ddash settings {[SETTING]}] \CrossIndex{command-line options}{settings}
            \SeeIndex{rc file}{webquizrc}
            \SeeIndex{default settings}{webquizrc}
            List system settings for webquiz stored in the \WebQuiz rc-file
            (\textit{run-time configuration file}); see the
            \BashCode|--rcfile| command-line option below. Optionally, a single
            \BashCode|SETTING| can be given in which case the value of only that
            setting is returned. Typical settings returned by this
            command look like:
            \InputBashCode{webquiz.settings}
            These settings are used by all of the quizzes created by
            \WebQuiz unless the quiz overrides them. These defaults are
            normally set when \WebQuiz is initialised, using the command:
            \BashCode|webquiz --initialise|. The defaults can be changed any time using:
            \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.

            If \BashCode|SETTING| is omitted then the list of current
            settings are printed. Use
            \BashCode|SETTING|$=$\BashCode|verbose| for
            a more verbose listing of the settings and
            \BashCode|SETTING|$=$\BashCode|help| for a summary of the
            settings.

            \textit{If you do not have permission to write to the system
            rc-file, which is in the \WebQuiz scripts directory, then you
            will be given the option of saving the \WebQuiz settings to an
            rc-file in your home directory or another file of your choice.
            If you want to save the settings to a particular rc-file use
            the \BashCode|--rcfile| option. If you want to change the
            system \webquizrc file then use a administrator account or,
            on a unix-like system,} use \BashCode|sudo webquiz --edit-settings|.

         \item[-r RCFILE, \ddash rcfile RCFILE]\index{webquizrc}
            Specify the rc-file (\textit{run-time configuration file}), file
            that \WebQuiz should read (and write to).

            By default, \WebQuiz will first read the system rc-file (the
            file \webquizrc in the \WebQuiz script directory),
            followed by the users rc-file in your home directory, which
            will typically be in the home directory but first preference
            will be given to the \BashCode|.dotfiles/config| directory
            if it exists (see \autoref{SS:rcfile}). If \WebQuiz is unable to
            write to the system rc-file then \WebQuiz will create an
            rc-file in your home directory, which it will subsequently
            read whenever you run \WebQuiz. This setting is only
            necessary if you want to override the default rc-file.

            The rc-file can be edited by hand, however, it is
            recommended that you instead use
            \begin{bashcode}
              webquiz --edit-settings
            \end{bashcode}

            \item[\ddash uninstall] Remove all \WebQuiz files from your
            web server directory. This command only removes files that
            \WebQuiz may have installed on your web server. It does
            \textit{not} remove \WebQuiz from your \LaTeX{} distribution.

          \end{description}

          \subsubsection*{Advanced options}

          \textit{An incorrect value for these settings may stop \WebQuiz from working.}

          \begin{description}
             \item[\ddash make4ht MAKE4HT-OPTIONS]
             \CrossIndex{command-line options}{make4ht}
            Options to be passed to \ctan{make4ht} when converting the
            \LaTeX{} to \XML. This option is equivalent to setting
            the \BashCode|make4ht| in the \webquizrc file; see
            \autoref{SS:rcfile}. At least under UNIX, multiple arguments
            should be enclosed in quotes.  For example, to give
            \ctan{make4ht} an mk4 file you would use
            \begin{bashcode}
                      > webquiz --make4ht "-e file.mk4" quiz.tex
            \end{bashcode}
            \WebQuiz provides the command-line options
            \BashCode|--shell-escape|, \BashCode|-lua|, \BashCode|--xelatex|,
            so the \BashCode|make4ht| command-line option will be required
            only in rare instances.
            \index{lualatex}\index{xelatex}

         \item[\ddash webquiz-layout WEBQUIZ-LAYOUT]
         \CrossIndex{command-line options}{layout}
            Local \python code for formatting the quiz web page. This
            option is equivalent to setting the \LatexCode|webquiz-layout|
            in the \webquizrc file.

      \end{description}

      \subsection{The \webquizrc file}\label{SS:customisation}
      \label{SS:rcfile}\index{default settings}

      \WebQuiz stores various \textit{run-time configuration settings} in
      the \webquizrc file. The system rc-file, \webquizrc, is
      saved in the \BashCode|scripts/webquiz| subdirectory of the
      \BashCode|TEXMFLOCAL| directory. If you are using \TeXLive (and
      possibly Mik\TeX?) you can find this directory using the command
      \begin{bashcode}
              kpsewhich -var-value=TEXMFLOCAL
      \end{bashcode}
      By default, the \WebQuiz settings are saved here so that you do not
      need to reinitialise \WebQuiz whenever you update your \TeX{}
      distribution. If you do not have permission to write to this
      directory then you will be asked if you would like to save the
      rc-file somewhere else.

      Each time \WebQuiz is run it first reads the system rc-file, if it
      exits, followed by the \textit{users rc-file}, which is the file
      \BashCode|.webquizrc| in the users home directory -- again, the users
      rc-file is read only if it exists. You can specify an arbitrary file
      as an rc-file using command  \BashCode|webquiz --rc-file|. When you change
      the \WebQuiz settings, using \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|, the new
      settings are saved in the last rc-file that was read, which will
      always be the rc-file given by \BashCode|webquiz --rc-file| when this
      command-line option is used.  As with the system rc-file, if you do
      not have permission to write to the specified rc-file then you will
      be asked for a different install location.

      Defaults for many of the generic \WebQuiz settings can be set the
      \webquizrc file. To describe these settings we consider separately
      the ``information settings'', the ``layout settings'' and the
      ``advanced settings'' that most people will not need and should not
      change.

      \subsubsection*{Configuration settings}
      \begin{description}

          \item[webquiz-url] This is the relative URL for webquiz web directory

          \item[webquiz-www] This is the full path to the webquiz web
              directory. The \OnlineManual and other example code can be
              found in the \BashCode|docs| subdirectory. If you use
              \BashCode|bash|, then the command
              \begin{bashcode}
                  > cd $(webquiz --settings webquiz-www)/docs
              \end{bashcode}%$
              will take you to the \WebQuiz on-line \BashCode|docs/| directory.

      \end{description}

      \subsubsection*{Department settings}
      \begin{description}

          \item[department]
            Sets the default department name; see \LatexCode|\Department| in
            \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs}\macroIndex{Department}

          \item[department-url]
            Sets the URL for the department; see \LatexCode|\DepartmentURL| in
            \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs}\macroIndex{DepartmentURL}

          \item[institution]
            Sets the default institution name. This is overrid see \LatexCode|\Institution| in
            \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs}\macroIndex{Department}

          \item[institution-url]
            Sets the URL for the institution; see \LatexCode|\InstitutionURL| in
            \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs} \macroIndex{InstitutionURL}

        \end{description}

        \subsubsection*{Formatting options}

        \begin{description}

          \item[breadcrumbs]\index{breadcrumbs}
            Sets the default breadcrumbs at the top of quiz page. The
            breadcrumbs can be overwritten in the quiz file using the
            \LatexCode{\BreadCrumbs} command. See \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs}
            for more details.  \macroIndex{BreadCrumbs}

          \item[engine] Sets the default \TeX{} engine to be used when
            compiling the quiz. By default, \BashCode|latex| is used, with
            the two other possibilities being \BashCode|lua| and
            \BashCode|xelatex|. Behind the scenes, the two choices
          correspond to invoking \ctan{make4ht} with the
          \BashCode|--lua| and \BashCode|--xelatex| options,
          respectively. The \BashCode|engine| setting in the  \webquizrc
          file is overridden by the command-line options
          \BashCode|--latex|, \BashCode|--lua| and \BashCode|--xelatex|.
          \index{lualatex}\index{xelatex}

        \item[language]\index{language}
          Sets the default language for the \WebQuiz web pages. This can
          be overridden in the quiz file by using the document class
          \LatexCode|language| option: \LatexCode|language=XXX|
          See \autoref{SS:classOptions}.

        \item[theme]\index{theme}
          Sets the default colour theme for the \WebQuiz web pages. This can
          be overridden in the quiz file by using the document class
          \LatexCode|theme| option: \LatexCode|theme=XXX|.
          See \autoref{SS:classOptions}.

      \end{description}

      \subsubsection*{Advanced options}

      \begin{description}

        \item[make4ht]\index{make4ht}
          Options for \ctan{make4ht}. Rather than using \TeXfht
          directly, \WebQuiz uses \ctan{make4ht} to convert the
          \LaTeX\ file to \XML. Use this option to
          customise how \ctan{make4ht} is called. See the
          \ctan[make4ht]{make4ht manual} for more information.

        \item[mathjax] \WebQuiz web pages use \href{https://www.mathjax.org/}{mathjax} to
          render the mathematics on the quiz web pages. By default this
          is done by loading \BashCode|mathjax| from
          \begin{bashcode}
             https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/mathjax/2.7.1/MathJax.js
          \end{bashcode}
          Fetching \BashCode|mathjax| from an external site can
          cause a delay when the quiz web pages are loaded. This setting
          in the rc-file allows you to change where \BashCode|mathjax| is
          loaded from. For example, if you install \BashCode|mathjax| on
          your web server then you would replace this will the
          corresponding relative URL.

        \item[webquiz-layout]
          Sets the \python file that writes the \HTML file for the quiz.
          Most people will not need this option. The next subsection
          describes how to do this in more detail.

    \end{description}

    The values of \LatexCode|breadcrumbs|, \LatexCode|department|,
    \LatexCode|department_url|, \LatexCode|institution| and
    \LatexCode|institution_url| can all be overwritten using the
    corresponding  \LaTeX{} commands in the quiz file; see
    \autoref{SS:breadcrumbs} for more details.

    \subsection{Changing the layout of the \WebQuiz web pages} \index{SS:layout}

    \begin{dangerous}
      \textit{This is an advanced \WebQuiz feature that most people will
      not need. To change the layout of the quiz web pages created by
      \WebQuiz requires working knowledge of \HTML and \python.}
    \end{dangerous}

    The construction of the online quizzes is controlled by the \python
    file \PythonCode|webquiz_standard.py|. If you want to change the structure
    of the web pages for the quizzes then the easiest way to do this is
    to make a copy of \PythonCode|webquiz_standard.py|, say
    \PythonCode|webquiz_myformat.py|, and then edit this file directly.
    This will require working knowledge of \python and \HTML. To give you
    an idea of what needs to be done, the \python file
    \PythonCode|webquiz_standard| contains a single function
    \PythonCode|write_web_page| that returns the \HTML for the page as
    a string using the following:
        \begin{htmlcode}
        quiz_page = r'''<!DOCTYPE HTML>
        <html lang="en">
          <head>
            <title> {title} </title>
            {htmlpreamble}
          </head>

          <body>
            {breadcrumbs}
            {no_script}
            <div class="quiz_page">
              {side_menu}
              <div class="quiz_questions">
                {quiz_header}
                {quiz_questions}
              </div>
            </div>
            {webquiz_init}
          </body>
        </html>
        '''
        \end{htmlcode}
  By changing this output you can change the layout of the quizzes
  produced by \WebQuiz. For example, by adding code to the
  \HTMLCode|<head>...</head>| section of \HTMLCode|quiz_page| it is easy
  to include new \CSS code and by modifying
  \HTMLCode|<body>....</body>|.  More sophisticated versions of
  \PythonCode|webquiz_standard.py|, where you change the underlying
  \python code, are possible.  For example, at the University of Sydney
  we have a custom version of \PythonCode|webquiz_standard| that calls
  our content management system and, in this way, embeds the quiz web
  page inside a standard web page for our university.

  When experimenting with a new layout can run
  \WebQuiz using the command:
  \begin{bashcode}
     > webquiz --webquiz-layout webquiz_myformat quizfile.tex
  \end{bashcode}
  Once you have finalised the new layout you can make this the default
  layout using
  \BashCode|webquiz --edit-settings|.\index{edit-settings}
  \index{webquiz-layout}

  If you do make modifications to any of these files it is advisable to
  create a version of the file \textit{with a different name}. This
  will make it easier for you to integrate your changes with any future
  released of \WebQuiz.

  \subsection{Bugs, issues and feature requests}\index{bug reports}
    Please report any bugs, issues or feature requests using the
    \textit{issue} tracker at
    \begin{quote}
    \href{https://\webquiz{repository}}{\webquiz{repository}}.
    \end{quote}
    When reporting a bug please provide a \textit{minimal working example}
    that clearly demonstrates your problem. This should be a compilable
    \LaTeX file that looks something like the following:
    \begin{latexcode}
       \documentclass{webquiz}
       \begin{document}
            ** insert problematic code here **
       \end{document}
    \end{latexcode}
    Bug reports that do not have a minimal working example are often
    hard to reproduce in which case it is not possible to fix them.
    Before submitting a bug export please first compile your quiz using
    (pdf)latex to check to see if your problem is an issue with \LaTeX
    or with \WebQuiz. If you can, please also test to see if your code
    compiles using \TeXfht directly.

  \subsection{Catalogue of web page themes}\index{SS:themes}\label{SS:themes}
  \WebQuiz{} comes with quite a few different themes for the on-line
  quizzes, which can be set using the \LatexCode|theme| documentclass
  option or in the \webquizrc file; see \autoref{SS:classOptions} for
  more details. Themes are easy to construct in principle although
  finding colour that work well together can be tricky in practice.
  Some of the available themes are quite garish, so perhaps the
  different themes should be interpreted as proof-of-concept rather
  than the final product.

  \input webquiz-themes.tex

  I am happy to include any new themes sent to me and to consider
  modifications of existing themes, although there is a potential
  technical issue here in that the underlying \CSS files are
  written using \href{http://sass-lang.com/}{sass}.  Any new themes can
  be sent to me using the \textit{issue} tracker at
    \href{https://\webquiz{repository}}{\webquiz{repository}}.

\subsection{The on-line WebQuiz manual}\label{S:online}

  \WebQuiz has an
  \href{http://www.maths.usyd.edu.au/u/mathas/WebQuiz/webquiz-online-manual.html}{on-line
  manual} that is a \LaTeX file written with the \LatexCode|webquiz|
  document class. The conversion of the manual from \LaTeX{} to \HTML is
  done by \WebQuiz. The \BashCode|PDF| version of this manual is included here for
  your convenience. The source file for the \OnlineManual is included
  in the documentation of \WebQuiz to allow you to create a local
  version of the \OnlineManual. Look for the file
  \BashCode|webquiz-online-manual.tex| in the \BashCode|webquiz-www/docs|
  directory; see~\autoref{SS:rcfile}.

  The \OnlineManual was written for ``internal use'' when \WebQuiz was
  first written in 2004. \WebQuiz has evolved quite a lot since then.
  There is quite a bit of overlap between the \OnlineManual and
  previous sections, however, the \OnlineManual only describes how to
  typeset questions and it does not cover some of the more recent
  features of \WebQuiz or how to use the program.  If there are any
  discrepancies between the \OnlineManual and the earlier sections of
  this manual then the \OnlineManual should be discounted.

  The \OnlineManual has diagrams that are drawn using \ctan{pstricks}
  and, as a result, to create a \BashCode|PDF| version of the \OnlineManual
  use \BashCode|latex webquiz-online-manual| to create a
  \BashCode|dvi| file. The \BashCode|dvi| file can be  converted to
  \BashCode|PDF| using \BashCode|dvipdf|.  If you try to use
  \BashCode|pdflatex| directly you will get an error.
